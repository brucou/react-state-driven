# Motivation
User interfaces are reactive systems which can be modelized accurately by state machines. There 
is a number of state machine libraries in the field with varying design objectives. We have proposed
 a state machine library with a minimal API, consisting of a single effect-less function. 
 
 In this particular design, the machine is a function which takes inputs (events to be processed 
 by the machine) and outputs commands to be executed. While it is entirely possible to modelize 
 an entire web application with state machines, a common use case is to modelize a
 component, and reuse that component. 
 
 This library proposes an integration of the Kingly state machine library with React that takes 
 the shape of a `<Machine />` component which can be used in a React application like any other 
 components. The `<Machine />` component will listen to user events, compute commands and execute
  them, generally leading to updating the screen.

# Installation
`react`  is a peer dependency. The component has been tested with React 16.4 and above. It may 
however work with lower versions of React as it does not use hooks, context, etc. If you 
encounter an issue with a given version of React, please log an issue.

```sh
npm install react-state-driven
```

# API

## ` <Machine fsm, renderWith, commandHandlers, eventHandler?, preprocessor?, effectHandlers?, 
options?, 
/>`

We expose a `<Machine />` React component which will hold the state machine and implement its 
behaviour using React's API. The `Machine` component behaviour is specified by its props. 

There are 3 mandatory props and four optional props. The three mandatory props are the machine 
specifying the component's behavior, the component to render the screens with, and the command 
handlers to execute the commands computed by the machine.

The four optional props exists to address more complex use cases without modifying the 
`<Machine/>` component. This is in line with the open-closed principle which states that 
"software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification". 

We will examine these use cases in a dedicated section. Let's now describe the semantics of the 
component:

- When the React `Machine` component is mounted, the `fsm` machine will be sent an event 
(called `MOUNTED` by default, and configurable in `options.initialEvent`). From that event, the 
machine generally computes the initial screen to be rendered. In fact the machine computes a 
`RENDER` command, which include the props for the `renderWith` component whose single 
responsibility is to render the screens for the `Machine` component.
  - Assuming `fsm({[MOUNTED]: void 0}) = [{command: RENDER, params: initialProps}]`, and 
  `renderWith = Component` the screen `<Component next {...initialProps} />` will be displayed when 
  the `Machine` component is mounted
- The `<Component />` rendering screens is injected by `<Machine />` with a `next` prop, which is
 an event dispatcher whose end is connected to the `fsm` machine. That means that `next(event)` 
 will trigger the computation of `fsm(event)`. The `next` prop is thus used by the `Component` to
  pass events that to the machine. Typically, as `Component` only handles rendering, the 
  aforementioned events are DOM or user events.
- The `fsm` machine computes commands in response to received events. The `commandHandlers` 
prop assigns handlers for every possible command generated by the machine. Computed commands are 
executed with the dedicated handler. Handlers are passed the `next` dispatcher as it is often 
necessary to pass back to the machine the results of an executed command. For instance, if a 
command fetches remote data, that remote data may be fed back to the machine in the shape of a 
`SUCCESS` event. Conversely, an `ERROR` event may be sent back to indicate that the fetching has 
failed.  

The previous paragraph describes how the mandatory props (`fsm`, `renderWith`, `commandHandlers`)
 are used. Let's talk about the optional props:
 
 - `eventHandler` defaults to a minimal event emitter based on `emitonoff`, a 300B library. You 
 can provide your own event emitter fitting your own purposes. The event handler must adhere to 
 an interface similar to that of Rx.js Subjects, i.e. needs to have a `next`, `error`, `complete`
  methods, in addition to a `subscribe` method. This means that using a Subject as event handler 
  is as easy as `eventHandler = new Rx.Subject()`
- the `preprocessor` is receiving all events sent by the `next` dispatcher and converting them 
into events for the `fsm` machine. The preprocessor defaults to `x => x` i.e. the identity 
function. 
- `effectHandlers` allows command handlers to be more single-concern. Executing a command may 
involve realizing and coordinating several effects. In a clean architecture, the command handlers
 should only orchestrate the sequence of effects realizing the commands, and  the effects should 
 only, well, execute a single effect. This is useful for testing purposes, as orchestration can 
 be tested separately from effect execution. 
- `options` is designed to be a bag that gathers all customization opportunities which do not 
belong to any of the other classifications. As of now, it includes an `initialEvent` property 
which configured the event that will be run through the machine when mounting the `<Machine />` 
component 

|Option|Use case| 
|---|---|
| eventHandler |- pass events from outside the component or from outside the DOM, for instance to communicate with other components|
|preprocessor|- convert one DOM event into one semantic event. For instance, convert a button click (no semantics) into a search intent or submit intent (note the semantics).|
| |- aggregate several DOM events into one event. For instance, throttle button clicks|
| |- pass events from outside the component or from outside the DOM, for instance to communicate with other components|
|effectHandlers|- large component, or complex behavior where clean code matters|
| |- customizing render handler (default is React.setState), for instance running some operations before or after rendering|
|options|- configure initial event. This also entirely decouples the `fsm` machine from the `Machine` component|

Note that our `Machine` component expects some props but does not expect children components. 

We provide two examples, one illustrating the mandatory props, the second illustrating all optional props.

## Example with mandatory props
This example only uses the mandatory props. It also uses JSX, and JSON patch to update the 
machine's extended state. We use JSON patch mainly to provide an example of configuration of 
`updateState` property. You may use a simple `Object.assign`-based reducer, or Immer or any other
 reducing function.

The demo application can be evaluated in a [codesandbox playground](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-movie-app-state-driven-with-default-options-18m62?file=/src/MovieSearch.js).

## Example with optional props
This example uses the optional props. It uses hyperscripts instead of JSX and a Rxjs Subject for 
event emitter, and JSON patch to update the machine's extended state.

We will implement an [image search application](https://css-tricks.com/robust-react-user-interfaces-with-finite-state-machines/#article-header-id-5). 
That application basically takes an input from the user, looks up images related
 to that search input, and displays them. The user can then click on a particular image to see it 
 in more details. 

For illustration, the user interface starts like this:

![image search interface](https://i.imgur.com/mDQQTX8.png?1) 

[Click here](https://codesandbox.io/s/flickr-search-app-with-kingly-qivl3) for a live demo.

The user interface behaviour can be modelized by the following machine:

![machine visualization](assets/image%20gallery%20state%20cat.png)

Note: 
- how the black bullet (entry point) from our machine graph corresponds to a `init` control 
state, which moves to the `start` control state with the initial event `START`.
- `events` and `states` respectively are a list of events and control states accepted and 
represented in the machine
- `initialControlState` and `initialExtendedState` encode the initial state for the machine
- the `transitions` property of the machine encodes the edges of the graph that modelizes the 
behaviour of the interface
- `updateState` specifies how to update the extended state of the machine from a description of 
the updates to perform. We use [JSON patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) in our example. A redux-like 
reducer, proxy-based `immer.js` or any user-provided function could also be used, as long as it 
respects the defined interface.

### A stateless component to render the user interface
The machine **controls** the user interface via the issuing of render commands, which include 
*props* for a user-provided React component. Here, those *props* are fed into `GalleryApp`, which
 renders the interface: 
 
 ```javascript
export function GalleryApp(props){
  // NOTE: `query` is not used! :-) Because we use a uncontrolled component, we need not 
  // keep track of the value of the input field
  const { query, photo, items, next, gallery: galleryState } = props;

  return div(".ui-app", { "data-state": galleryState }, [
    h(
      Form,
      {
        galleryState,
        onSubmit: (ev, formRef) => next(["onSubmit", ev, formRef]),
        onClick: ev => next(["onCancelClick"])
      },
      []
    ),
    h(
      Gallery,
      { galleryState, items, onClick: item => next(["onGalleryClick", item]) },
      []
    ),
    h(Photo, { galleryState, photo, onClick: ev => next(["onPhotoClick"]) }, [])
  ]);
}

```

Note:
- `GalleryApp` is a **stateless functional component** which only concerns itself with rendering 
the user interface, i.e. a pure React component.


### Implementing the user interface with `<Machine />` 
We have our state machine defined, we have a component to render the user interface. We now have 
to implement the full user interface, e.g. processing events, and execute the appropriate 
commands in response. As we will use the `<Machine />` component, we have to 
specify the corresponding *props* for it. Those *props* include, as the architecture indicates, 
an interface by which the user interface sends events to a preprocessor which transforms them 
into inputs for the state machine, which produces commands which are processed by command 
handlers, which delegate the actual effect execution to effect handlers: 

```javascript
import { COMMAND_RENDER, COMMAND_SEARCH, NO_INTENT } from "./properties"
import { filter, map } from "rxjs/operators"
import { runSearchQuery, destructureEvent } from "./helpers"
import { INIT_EVENT } from "state-transducer"
import { Subject } from "rxjs/index"
import { GalleryApp } from "./imageGalleryComponent"
import Flipping from "flipping"
import React from "react";

const flipping = new Flipping();

export const imageGalleryReactMachineDef = {
  options: { initialEvent: [ "START"] },
  renderWith: GalleryApp,
  eventHandler: new Subject(),
  preprocessor: rawEventSource =>
    rawEventSource.pipe(
      map(ev => {
        const { rawEventName, rawEventData: e, ref } = destructureEvent(ev);

        if (rawEventName === INIT_EVENT) {
          return { [INIT_EVENT]: void 0 };
        }
        // Form raw events
        else if (rawEventName === "START") {
          return { START: void 0 };
        } else if (rawEventName === "onSubmit") {
          e.persist();
          e.preventDefault();
          return { SEARCH: ref.current.value };
        } else if (rawEventName === "onCancelClick") {
          return { CANCEL_SEARCH: void 0 };
        }
        // Gallery
        else if (rawEventName === "onGalleryClick") {
          const item = e;
          return { SELECT_PHOTO: item };
        }
        // Photo detail
        else if (rawEventName === "onPhotoClick") {
          return { EXIT_PHOTO: void 0 };
        }
        // System events
        else if (rawEventName === "SEARCH_SUCCESS") {
          const items = e;
          return { SEARCH_SUCCESS: items };
        } else if (rawEventName === "SEARCH_FAILURE") {
          return { SEARCH_FAILURE: void 0 };
        }

        return NO_INTENT;
      }),
      filter(x => x !== NO_INTENT),
    ),
  commandHandlers: {
    [COMMAND_SEARCH]: (next, query, effectHandlers) => {
      effectHandlers
        .runSearchQuery(query)
        .then(data => {
          next(["SEARCH_SUCCESS",data.items]);
        })
        .catch(error => {
          next(["SEARCH_FAILURE", void 0]);
        });
    }
  },
  effectHandlers: {
    runSearchQuery: runSearchQuery,
    [COMMAND_RENDER]: (machineComponent, renderWith, params, next) => {
      // Applying flipping animations : read DOM before render, and flip after render
      flipping.read();
      machineComponent.setState(
        { render: React.createElement(renderWith, Object.assign({}, params, { next }), []) },
        () => flipping.flip()
      );
    }
  }
};

``` 

Note:
- we render the user interface with the `GalleryApp` component (`renderWith`)
- we use Rxjs for event handling between the component and the interfaced systems
- we kick start the machine with the `START` event (`options.initialEvent`)
- inputs received from the interfaced systems (network responses or user inputs) are translated 
into inputs for the state machine by the preprocessor (`preprocessor`)
- our interface only performs two actions on its interfaced systems : rendering screens, and 
querying remote content. As the rendering command is implemented by the `<Machine />` component, `commandHandlers` only implement the `COMMAND_SEARCH` command (`commandHandlers`).
- the `COMMAND_SEARCH` command use the `runSearchQuery` effect runner (`effectHandlers`)
- the render command can be customized if necessary by specifying an alternative render 
implementation. Here we wanted to use the `Flipping` animation library, which requires running 
some commands before and after updating the DOM. That forced us to customize the rendering.

#### The final application set-up
We now have all the pieces to integrate for our application:

```javascript
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./index.css";
import { Machine } from "react-state-driven";
import { imageGalleryFsmDef } from "./imageGalleryFsm";
import { imageGalleryReactMachineDef } from "./imageGalleryReactMachineDef";
import h from "react-hyperscript";
import {
  createStateMachine,
} from "kingly";

const fsm = createStateMachine(imageGalleryFsmDef, {});

ReactDOM.render(
  // That is the same as <Machine fsm=... preprocessor=... ... />
  h(Machine, Object.assign({}, imageGalleryReactMachineDef, { fsm }), []),
  document.getElementById("root")
);

```

### A typical machine run
Alright, now let's leverage the example to explain what is going on here together with the 
`<Machine />` semantics.

First of all, we use `React.createElement` but you 
could just as well use jsx `<Machine ... />`, that really is but an implementation detail. In our
 implementation we are mostly using core React API and [hyperscript](https://github.com/mlmorg/react-hyperscript) rather than jsx. Then keep in mind that when we write 'the 
 machine', we refer to the state machine whose graph has been given previously. When we want to 
 refer to the `Machine` React component, we will always specifically precise that.
 
Our state machine is basically a function which takes an input and returns outputs. The inputs 
received by the machine are meant to be mapped to events triggered by the user through the user 
interface. The outputs from the machine are commands representing what commands/effects to perform 
on the interfaced system(s). The mapping between user/system events and machine input is 
performed by `preprocessor`. The commands output  by the machine are mapped to handlers gathered 
in `commandHandlers` so our `Machine`  component knows how to run a command when it receives one.

A run of the machine would then be like this :
- The machine will encapsulate the following properties as part of its extended state : `query`, 
`items`, `photo`. This extended state will be updated according to the machine specifications in 
function of the input received by the machine and the control state the machine is in.  
- The initial extended state is `{ query: '', items: [], photo: undefined }`
- The machine transitions automatically from the initial state to the `start` control state.
  - on doing so, it issues one command : render `GalleryApp`. Render commands have a default 
  handler which renders the `renderWith` component passed as parameter with the *props* included 
  in the render command. An event emitter (`next` in 
  code sample above) is passed to allow for the element to send events to the state machine.
- The `Machine` component executes the render command and renders a gallery app with an
   empty query text input, no images(`items`), and no selected image (`photo`).
- The user enters some text in the text input
- The user clicks the `Search` button. 
  - A `submit` event is triggered.
  - The value of the input field is read, and the `submit` event is transformed into a 
  machine input `{SEARCH : <query>}` which is passed to the machine
  - The machine, per its specifications, outputs two commands : `COMMAND_SEARCH` and render 
  `GalleryApp`, and transitions to `loading` control state 
  - The `Machine` component executes the two commands : the gallery is rendered (this time with a
   `Cancel` button appearing), and an API call is made. Depending on the eventual result of that 
   API call, the command handler will trigger a `SEARCH_SUCCESS` or `SEARCH_FAILURE` event.
- The search is successful : the `SEARCH_SUCCESS` event is transformed into a machine 
input `{SEARCH_SUCCESS: items}`. 
  - The machine, per its specifications, updates its extended state `items` property, and outputs
   a render `GalleryApp` command. This displays the list of fetched items on the screen.
- Any further event will lead to the same sequence : 
  - the user or an interfaced system (network, etc.) triggers an event X,
  - that event will be transformed into a machine input (as per `preprocessor`), 
  - the machine will, as per its specs, update its extended state and issue command(s) 
  - Issued commands will be executed by the `Machine` component, as per `commandHandlers`

This is it! Whatever the machine passed as parameter to the `Machine` component, its behaviour 
will always be as described.

Note that this example is contrived for educational purposes:
- we could do away with the preprocessor and have the DOM event handlers directly produce inputs in 
the format accepted by the machine
- we could handle concurrency issues (user makes a second search while the first search request 
is in-flight) either reusing rxjs capabilities (`switchMap`) or at the machine level (extra piece
 of state)

### Types
Types  can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/brucou/react-state-driven/tree/master/types). 

### Contracts
- command handlers delegate **all effects on external systems** through the effect handler module
- the `COMMAND_RENDER` command is reserved and must not be used in the command handlers' 
specifications
- types contracts
- `next` is injected as a *prop* to the `renderWith` component and as such cannot be overriden by 
the component's defined *props*

### Semantics
- The `<Machine />` component:
  - initializes the raw event source (subject) which receives and forwards all raw events 
  (user events and system events)
  - creates a global command handler to dispatch to user-defined command handlers
  - connects the raw event source to the preprocessor
  - connects the preprocessor to the machine
  - connects the machine to the command handler
  - starts the machine: the machine is now reactive to raw events and computes the associated commands
- The preprocessor will receive raw events from two sources : the user interface and the external
 systems (databases, etc.). From raw events, it will compute inputs for the connected state 
 machine. Note that:
  - the preprocessor may perform effects only on the user interface (for instance `e => e.preventDefault()`)
  - the preprocessor may have its own internal state
- The machine receives preprocessed events from the preprocessor and computes a set of commands 
to be executed
- The global command handler execute the incoming commands :
  - if the command is a render command, the global handler executes directly the command in the 
  context of the `<Machine/>` component
  - if the command is not a render command, the global handler dispatches the command to the 
  user-configured command handlers
- All command handlers are passed two arguments : 
  - an event emitter connected to the raw event source
  - an object of type `EffectHandlers` which contains any relevant dependencies needed to 
  perform effects (that is the object passed in props to the `<Machine/>` component)
- Render commands leads to definition of React components with DOM event handlers. Those event 
  handlers can pass their raw events (DOM events) to the machine thanks to the raw event source 
  emitter
- Non-render commands leads to the execution of procedures which may be successful or fail. The
   command handler can pass back information to the machine thanks to the injected event emitter. 
- The raw event source is created with the subject factory passed as parameters. That subject must 
implement the `Observer` interface (in particular have the `next, complete, error` properties 
defined, with all of them being **synchronous** functions) and the `Observable` interface 
(`subscribe` property)
- The event source is terminated when the `<Machine/>` component is removed from the screen 
(`componentWillUnmount` lifecycle method)


# Modelling user interfaces with state machines
We are going all along to refer to a image search application example to illustrate our 
argumentation. Cf. [Example section](#example) for more details.

In a traditional architecture, a simple scenario would be expressed as follows:

![image search basic scenario](assets/Image%20search%20scenario.png)

What we can derive from that is that the application is interfacing with other systems : the user
 interface and what we call external systems (local storage, databases, etc.). The application 
 responsibility is to translate user actions on the user interface into commands on the external systems, execute those commands and deal with their result.

In our proposed architecture, the same scenario would become:

![image search basic scenario](assets/Image%20search%20scenario%20with%20fsm.png)

In that architecture, the application is refactored into a mediator, a preprocessor, a state 
machine, a command handler, and an effect handler. The application is thus split into smaller parts 
which address specific concerns :
- the preprocessor translates user interface events into inputs for the state machine
- the state machine computes the commands to execute as a result of its present and past inputs, 
or, what is equivalent, its present input and current state 
- the command handler interprets and executes incoming commands, delegating the execution of 
effects to the effect handler when necessary
- the mediator orchestrates the user interface, the preprocessor, the state machine and the command 
handler

While the architecture may appear more complex (isolating concerns means more parts), we have 
reduced the complexity born from the interconnection between the parts. 

Concretely, we increased the testability of our implementation :
- the mediator algorithm is the same independently of the pieces it coordinates. This means it 
can be written and tested once, then reused at will. This is our `<Machine />` component. **This is
 glue code that you do not have to write and test anymore**
- effect handlers are pretty generic pieces of code. An example could be code to fetch a 
resource. That code is written and tested once (and comes generally tested out of the box), and 
then reused for any resource. Additionally, only the effect handlers can perform effects on the 
external systems, which helps testing, tracing and debugging[^3]
- effect handlers, being isolated in their own module, are easy to mock, without resorting to 
a complex machinery specific to a testing library
- the state machine is a function which **performs no effects**, and whose output exclusively depends 
on current state, and present input[^2]. We will use the term *causal* functions for such 
functions, in  reference to [causal systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_system), which 
exhibit the same property[^1]. The causality property means state machines are a breeze
 to reason about and test (well, not as much as pure functions, but infinitely better than 
 effectful functions)
- only the preprocessor and mediator can perform effects on the user interface, which helps 
testing, tracing and debugging 

We also have achieved greater modularity: our parts are coupled only through their interface. For
 instance, we use in our example below `Rxjs` for preprocessing events, and [`state-transducer`](https://github.com/brucou/state-transducer) as state machine library. We could easily switch to [`most`](https://github.com/cujojs/most) and [`xstate`](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate) if the need be, or to a barebone event emitter (like `emitonoff`) by simply building interface adapters.

There are more benefits but this is not the place to go about them. Cf:
- [User interfaces as reactive systems](https://brucou.github.io/posts/user-interfaces-as-reactive-systems/)
- [Pure UI](https://rauchg.com/2015/pure-ui)
- [Pure UI control](https://medium.com/@asolove/pure-ui-control-ac8d1be97a8d)

[^3]: Command handlers can only perform effects internally (for instance async. communication 
with the mediator)    
[^2]: In relation with state machines, it is the same to say that 
      an output depends exclusively on past and present inputs and that an output exclusively depends 
      on current state, and present input.    
[^1]: Another term used elsewhere is *deterministic* functions, but we 
      found that term could be confusing.

# API design goals
We want to have an integration which is generic enough to accommodate a large set of use cases, 
and specific enough to be able to take advantage as much as possible of the `React` ecosystem 
and API. Unit-testing should ideally be based on the specifications of the behaviour of the 
component rather than its implementation details, and leverage the automatic test generator of 
the underlying `state-tranducer` library. In particular :

- it should be seamless to use both controlled and uncontrolled components
- it should be possible to use without risk of interference standard React features like `Context`
- it should use the absolute minimum React features internally, in order to favor for instance a 
painless port to React copycats (Preact, etc.)
- non-React functionalities should be coupled only through interfaces, allowing to use any 
suitable implementation
- the specifics of the implementation should not impact testing (hooks, suspense, context, etc.)

As a result of these design goals :
- we do not use React hooks, context, portal, fragments, `jsx`, and use the minimum React lifecycle 
hooks
- the component user can of course use the whole extent of the API at disposal, those restrictions 
only concern our implementation of the `<Machine />` component.
- we defined interfaces for extended state updates (reducer interface), event processing 
(observer and observable interfaces).
- any state machine implementation (including one that uses no dedicated library) can be 
substituted to our library provided that it respects the machine interface and contracts: 
  - the machine is implemented by a function
  - it takes an unique input parameter of the shape `{[event name]: event data}`
  - it returns an array of commands
  - it produces no effects
- we use dependency injection to pass the modules responsible for effects to the `<Machine />` component

# Tips and gotchas
- most of the time `preprocessor` will just change the name of the event. You can 
perfectly if that makes sense, use `preprocessor : x => x` and directly pass on the raw 
events to the machine as input. That is fine 
  - as long as the machine never has to perform an effect (this is one of the machine's contract)
  . In our example, you will notice that we are doing `e.preventDefault()` in the preprocessor. 
  Furthermore, for documentation and design purposes, it makes sense to use any input 
  nomenclature which links to the domain rather than the user interface. As we have seen, what is
   a **button click** on the interface is a **search input** for the machine, and results in a 
   **search command** to the command handler. 
  - if the machine at hand is only designed for that user interface and not intended to be reused
 in any other context. This approach as a matter of fact couple the view to the machine. In the 
 case of our image gallery component, we could imagine a reusable parameterizable machine which 
 implements the behaviour of a generic search input. Having a preprocessor enables to integrate 
 such machines without a hiccup.
- some machine inputs may correspond to the aggregation of several events (in advanced usage). For 
instance, if we had to recreate a double click for the `Search` button, we would have to receive 
two clicks before passing a `SEARCH` input to the machine. Having an `eventHandler` interface 
allows to use `Rxjs` to deal with those cases, as its combinator library (`map`, `filter`, 
`takeUntil` etc.) allow to aggregate events in a fairly simple manner. Note that we could 
implement this logic in the state machine itself (our machines are essentially Turing machines, they can implement any effect-less computation), but: 
  1. it may be better to keep the machine dealing with inputs at a consistent level of 
  abstraction; 2. that kind of event aggregation is done easily enough with a dedicated 
  library such as `rxjs`
- you may want to handle some concurrency issues at the machine level. Typically in our 
example, that would mean handling the user scenario when the user is requesting two 
different queries in rapid succession and the first query response has not arrived before the 
second query is executed. There is in this case a risk of the user interface displaying the wrong
 response.
- you may also want to do it at the command handler level to keep your machine at a higher level 
of abstraction. A command handler may for instance recreate Rxjs's `switchMap` by keeping a record
 of in-flight queries.
- the interfaced systems can communicate with the machine via an event emitter. The 
`props.renderWith` React component is injected a `next` *prop* which is an event emitter which 
relays events to the machine's raw event source. Associated with DOM event handlers, this allows 
the machine to receive DOM events. Command handlers are also passed the `next` event emitter, and
 can use it to send to the machine any messages from the interfaced systems. 
- in those cases where the machine needs to communicate with other local but out of scope entities,
 it can emit its own events, for instance custom DOM events
